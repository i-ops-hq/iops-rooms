# Security

Rooms by I-Ops is local-first. Treat every MCP and skill as untrusted until you have read it — including this one.

## What this package will never do

- Open sockets to the internet, `fetch` remote URLs, or DNS phone-home (no telemetry)
- Bind a listen socket to anything other than `127.0.0.1` (optional `rooms live` is localhost-only)
- Read `process.env` wholesale or hunt for `.env`, SSH keys, or cloud credentials
- Write outside `.room/` in the project it resolved (except a small device identity file under `~/.iops-rooms/device.json`)
- Run shell commands or `eval` user/agent text
- Install other packages at runtime
- Load scripts, fonts, or pixels from the public internet in `board.html`
- `file://` board stays fully offline; `rooms live` may EventSource the same localhost origin only
- Host your room on I-Ops cloud

## What it does

- Read/write `.room/room.json`, `.room/events.jsonl`, `.room/board.html`
- Stamp each event with a stable `deviceId` + display name (override with `ROOMS_DEVICE_ID` / `ROOMS_ACTOR`)
- Speak MCP over **stdio only**
- Render a static HTML file from `templates/board.html`
- Optional: `rooms live` serves that board on `127.0.0.1` and auto-reloads open tabs when `.room/` changes
- Optional: export/import a `.room/` folder for git-friendly handoff (still offline)

## Sync story

Network is **off** by default. When sync exists later, it is among **your team's own devices** (peer / LAN / machines you control) — not I-Ops reading or hosting the room.

## How to verify

1. Read `src/` — unminified.
2. Pin a version in `mcp.json` (`npx -y iops-rooms@0.1.0 mcp`), never `@latest`.
3. Open `.room/board.html` as `file://` and confirm the network tab is empty.
4. Optional `rooms live` — confirm it binds `127.0.0.1` only; DevTools should show only same-origin `/stream`.
5. `rooms status` / `rooms whoami` print local paths and identity; there is no account.

If a build starts requiring network for the core room, that is a bug. Optional relays will be explicit (`--relay`) and off by default.
